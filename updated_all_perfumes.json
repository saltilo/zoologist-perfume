    "description": "From the ethereal perspective of the exquisitely adorned hummingbird, the world is an endless kaleidoscope of colourful, fragrant blooms offering up their tempting delights. An insatiable desire for sweetness propels the hummingbird as it floats from flower to flower, sampling the nectar with a gentle touch of its delicate tongue. Retreating to its lichen and moss-lined nest, it settles into the cozy cocoon and dreams of sweet ambrosia.\nZoologist Hummingbird mingles light floral tones with delectable fruity nectars to create a harmonious balance. This diaphanous scent alights upon you in a pastel bouquet of honeysuckle, mimosa, lilac and peonies, with just the lightest dusting of natural sugars found in pear, cherry and honey. A finishing dollop of velvety whipped cream melds the tantalizing notes, completing this irresistible and opulent perfume.",

Face down, guided by the sun, it propels the tightly-packed dung backwards to a burrow lined with dusky spheres. Underground, it tunnels into the ball to deposit a precious egg. In time, the larva hatches and feeds, until it emerges, fully formed, and instinct drives it down the same dusty trail to repeat the cycle.\nLike Egyptians entrusting sacred mummies to tombs for the journey to the next life, a scarab burying its treasure marks the dawn of new life. Zoologist Sacred Scarab captures the mystique of Kyphi incense, a blend of blue lotus, raisins, plums, olibanum, myrrh, and juniper.

Under a carpet of narcotic flower blossoms, a smattering of coffee berries peppers the ground. The moist air is heavy with mossy aromas that penetrate every crevice, but the musky scent of the civets dominates; their marked territory daring one to enter at one’s own risk.\nZoologist Civet pays homage to the age-old ingredient, civet, as well as chypre perfumes of bygone days – perfumes that refused to be intimidated by raw, alluring, animalistic musks. Civet is a moody and complex brew entwined in mystery. It opens with a spicy floral accord, threaded through with dark coffee tones. Slowly it prowls forward, unraveling base notes of leather, moss and vanilla that combines with distinctive civet musk to create a bewildering, sophisticated scent with the promise of a sultry nighttime rendezvous.",

Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. The hunt ends abruptly as a monolith materializes, greedily engulfing all in its path. The massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Decades on, relics of the battle resurface. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.\nZoologist Squid sings a song of the sea, a melancholy tale told through tangy brine, crisp incense, and sweet, cloudy ink, all united by the moody aroma of ambergris.

But at the base of several bare trunks, invisible love notes call to a would-be mate. The fragrant missives are secretions left by the male musk deer. Long fangs give the buck a demonic appearance, but they too play a role in the mating ritual – weapons in the tussle with rivals for a doe's love. The dream of a mate sustains the lonely musk deer as it searches out scraps of lichen and moss among cold, barren roots.\nFor centuries musk deer have been hunted to near extinction, coveted for their fragrant musk pods. Zoologist respects this majestic creature, masterfully recreating the distinctive scent though a mixture of synthetic musks and natural oud and florals. The result evokes the animal desire of a lusty musk deer amid the alluring chill of a wintry forest, all captured without a hint of menace.",

Stumbling drunkenly across the forest floor they feasted on overripe fruit where it lay, dropped for them by the lush island paradise that nurtured them. For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, fragrant herbs and ferns are spiked with an invigorating splash of bergamot, juicy pineapple and blackcurrant, before the fruity aroma stumbles into a more traditional fougère. Spices frolic among notes of lavender, tonka and oakmoss, and settle down with beautiful woody undertones of oak. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic but fun, unknowable but impossibly unforgettable. The ideal perfume for those with an eclectic sensibility who crave a life of leisure and contentment.",

Tucked high in the crook of a tree, the koala is oblivious to the mesmerizing views. It would rather curl into a ball and sleep off a feast of oily eucalyptus, the aromatic leaves that sustain it. Despite their sleepy demeanour and friendly expression, koalas are territorial creatures. Males mark the soaring trunks with their musk, establishing their dominance.\nZoologist Koala opens with an invigorating blend of lemony honey and the sweet aroma of eucalyptus. They float above a blanket of black tea and spices, then draw you even deeper into musky amber and woods. The result is a unique and carefree scent that snuggles in around you, enveloping you in an embrace both playful and independent.",

When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes.\nAt first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and powdery florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame.",

Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era.

The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs – an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing.\nMadagascar, home to half of the world’s species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island.

From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.\nAt the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery – African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature. This unique perfume skillfully blends saffron, pink pepper, whiskey, rose and musks to invoke an abstract image of a dusty African mountainscape. Like the nimble hyraxes that spill from hillside crevices in search of the sun upon their musky hides, this scent will weave its way into your senses with a light but primal touch.",

But a flick of its slithering tail betrays the snake, sending the rodent darting away. Thwarted, the snake curls back upon itself, only to feel the cool touch of a menacing shadow of a towering King Cobra witnessing its failure. Now the predator becomes prey and there’s no escape. Intent on a breakfast devoured whole and without mercy, the hooded king strikes. Fangs sink deep, their venom coursing through the body of the snake. Instantly paralyzing heart and lungs, the toxins set to work dissolving the flesh from the inside out.\nKing Cobra from Zoologist is driven by danger and a desire to dominate. It hypnotizes with camphorous notes of Ganja and petitgrain, radiating coils of aromatic spices and damp mossy soil around a body heavy with incense.

    "description": "Huge trees quake at their approach, vulnerable leaves shuddering as the ground rumbles under heavy footsteps. They come with appetites as massive as their lumbering bodies. Nothing is spared from their bottomless hunger – trees stripped bare, roots upturned, even the tiniest blooms cannot escape their grasp. When the behemoths move on, they leave behind a path of destruction. Yet what often looks like carnage is actually a renaissance. The elephants fulfill a vital role – purging the delicate ecosystem, allowing new life to flourish.\nFrom beneath a canopy of lush, damp foliage, the complex aromas of Zoologist Elephant emerge. Into a mixture of invigorating Darjeeling and incense, swirl hints of coconut and cocoa. With the patience of a foraging herd stripping the bark from a thicket of trees, the fragrance dissipates gradually. What is revealed is the core of the perfume – a beautiful and satisfying blend of woody notes, which dry down to an elegant, natural sandalwood scent.",

Dangling high among the treetops may seem a dubious defence against peril, but for leisurely sloths the forest canopy offers a protective shroud. Safe in their leafy fortress, the sluggish creatures move so slowly even moss overtakes them. They snooze in a cradle of moist green aromas, oblivious to the chaos below.\nZoologist Sloth captures the tranquility of this sleepy beast in a soothing green essence. Calming lavender, chamomile, marigold and jasmine combine with the stillness of bittersweet hay and damp moss, stitched together by threads of luscious incense. The result is dreamy and exotic. As it settles on the skin, Sloth carries one up to a place where stresses simply tumble away.",

For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, notes of jackfruit and bergamot border a winding path dappled with aromatic turmeric and pink pepper. Venture along it to the heart of an island forest where hints of powdery orris emerge from beneath a potpourri of lavender, geranium, and orange flower.

As the deer’s life fades, its herd is already gone, evaporating into the night.\nLike the thrill inspired by a low, rumbling growl cutting through silence, Zoologist Tiger couples danger with majesty.

For the pouch of the male seahorse tenderly cradles a precious clutch of eggs.\nZoologist Seahorse invites you to wade through a vibrant coral garden. This unisex scent turns expectation on its head. With such surprising couplets as tuberose and seaweed, sage and neroli, and fennel and vetiver, this delightful melody will sweep you away on a wave of joy and abandon.",
